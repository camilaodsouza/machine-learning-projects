## Sentiment Analysis

Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushagra3204/sentiment-and-emotion-analysis-dataset

The idea here is to train a simple model to perform sentiment analysis and then deploy to a web application where a user can test it. 

To deploy the website, I'm using AWS EC2. 


To-do: 
* Deploy basic website to EC2 
* Train basic model to perform Sentiment Analysis
* Deploy model to website
